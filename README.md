# Master's Thesis: Task Scheduling in a Green Edge Computing Environment

## Introduction

Modern society relies on communication among digital devices. Edge Computing minimizes communication latency for applications like virtual reality, autonomous driving, and IoT. It also enhances data security and facilitates data management and network scalability.

Task scheduling within Edge Computing is crucial for efficient operation. It involves assigning tasks to edge infrastructure nodes, aiming to optimize system objectives such as execution time, energy consumption, and revenue for the network provider.

"Green Edge Computing" assumes that edge nodes are powered by renewable energy sources, representing an eco-friendly solution. This allows for task scheduling that minimizes environmental impact while maximizing revenue.

## Thesis Goals and Methodology

This Master's Thesis seeks to maximize the revenue of edge infrastructure providers through task scheduling in a green edge computing environment, optimizing the use of green energy. I formalized the problem with integer linear programming, resulting in two model variants. Both model variants provide centralized solutions, offering not only optimal task scheduling but also upper bounds for comparison.

Moreover, a significant contribution to the field lies in the design and implementation of an innovative online algorithm to effectively address the problem, balancing revenue maximization and sustainability.

## Experimental Analysis

I conducted an experimental campaign, analyzing the performance of the integer linear programming model and the heuristic. Results are promising, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of system revenue and task acceptance.

## Conclusion

This thesis explores task scheduling in green edge computing, offering insights into eco-friendly and revenue-maximizing practices.
